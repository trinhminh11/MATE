    heading, and distance to the target. That weighting makes currently loaded targets
    the default priority, but still prefers the loaded target that can be reacquired
    with less steering and less delay.

    After selecting the best target, the camera rotates to center it and adapts the
    viewing angle to match the target distance, using a tighter cone for distant targets
    and a wider cone for nearby ones. If no remembered target remains plausible, the

    strong priority bonus, yet the score additionally rewards targets whose distance is
    close to a useful cone-coverage regime, so the selected pose is more likely to keep
    a broad and efficient field of view instead of collapsing into narrow tunnel vision.

    In effect, the policy trades some urgency for better geometric coverage. It tends

    more time probing uncertain or weakly characterized targets, which can expose new
